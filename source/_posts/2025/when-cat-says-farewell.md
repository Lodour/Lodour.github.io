大约几个月前，一位同事的猫在半夜跑到床边轻轻拍了拍他，但他当时以为猫只是在玩闹，就没有理她转头继续睡觉。结果第二天早上醒来发现猫去世了，是18岁的老猫。他最难过的点在于他觉得猫是在向他求救，但他永远错过了这个机会。我在那一瞬间就感受到了他所经受的巨大愧疚，我曾经也有许多类似的愧疚感，所以想着我应该说些什么。只是看着其他人说的 sorry for your loss 又止不住觉得冷漠和苍白无力，毕竟我们无法改变这个世界已经写下的历史，内心的愧疚感也只有时间才能慢慢磨平。

回家的路上，我不知不觉把自己代入到了猫猫年迈的灵魂里，我忽然感觉到她其实并不是在求救，而是在看遍了她眼中的那个世界里所有的悲欢之后，想要和陪伴了一辈子的主人静静地告别。我想，如果是我在那个时间节点，我的心里应该不会有什么执念，而是担心不能再照顾自己所在意的人吧。

于是回到家以后就趁着灵感还在，静静写下了这封信。只是自己的英文不够优雅，也不知道能不能表达出真情实感。

Hi XXX,

I just saw your message when scrolling through the chat history.

I also have a cat, and if I recall correctly, 18 years old for a cat is like 90 for a human, which is around the age of my grandparents. Putting it that way, I believe from her perspective, her soul must have journeyed through a more profound history than all of us. While to us it seems you've been taking care of her, I believe she's also been watching over you for her entire life, just as a grandparent would, knowing all along how much you have tried your best to care for her. 

For that same reason, I believe she has gained a more matured way of viewing the world and witnessed all the joys and sorrows life has to offer. In her final years, I imagine she remained as peaceful as a wise elder, again, much like a grandparent would. I believe she was at peace with saying farewell, and would hope for you to find strength in the days ahead, as she watches over you from beyond this world.

I hope for the same.

-YYY
